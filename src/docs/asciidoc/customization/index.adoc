== Customization

This plugin is an extension of link:https://github.com/grails/scaffolding[Grails Scaffolding Core]. To change how markup is rendered in the html templates, see the scaffolding core link:http://grails.github.io/scaffolding/{scaffoldingCoreVersion}/[documentation]. The following changes have been made:

. The `propertyMarkupRenderer` bean has been set to an instance of link:api/org/grails/plugin/scaffolding/angular/markup/AngularPropertyMarkupRenderer.groovy[AngularPropertyMarkupRenderer] that only overrides the link:api/org/grails/plugin/scaffolding/angular/markup/AngularPropertyMarkupRendererImpl.html#getStandardAttributes(DomainProperty)[getStandardAttributes] method to add an `[(ngModel)]` attribute.
. The `contextMarkupRenderer` has been set to an instance of link:api/org/grails/plugin/scaffolding/angular/markup/AngularContextMarkupRenderer.groovy[AngularContextMarkupRenderer] that overrides the list output context to use an `*ngFor`.
. Additional input and output renderers are registered with a priority of 0. If you wish your own renderers to be used, set a priority higher than 0. See the link:http://grails.github.io/scaffolding/{scaffoldingCoreVersion}/#_how_properties_are_rendered[section on how properties are rendered] in the scaffolding core documentation for more details on how to do so.

The JavaScript templates used to create assets can be overridden by executing `grails ngInstallTemplates`. That will put a set of files in `src/main/templates/angular`. You can modify the templates and they will be used in future angular code generation. You can safely remove any templates that you do not wish to override.
